            Yashshree Egg Suppliers established in 2010. There was our poultry farm of country and broiler hens. We used to sell hens and thier eggs. At that time our business was very small and it was not online. We were supplying eggs to few customers most of them were retailers. At that time we needs to keep records of delivery. But if customer had not paid his outstanding and when he used to came next time it becames difficult to search his record. Also to delete record we need to serach his record in that large notebook which was tadious job. But we continued our business with that. In March 2020 when lockdown were announced by PM we were in bad situation. Because customers were not able to reach us and  we are not able to sale our products. We had hope that lockdown will open soon. But we were wrong. So we decide to make our business online. We launched our new website www.yes.freevar.com. We are very happy to see you here.
   In this online business we dont have need to manualy keep records. Record are automatically saved when customer places orders and make payment.
  In our online business customer open thier account by providing his/her information like name,phone,address etc. Once account is created one can place order. After that do payment. Payment can be done in cash at the time of delivery. Order is deliverd in 1 or 2 days. Customer can see their orders and payment details by log in to their account. We use customers data only to deliver orders. Customer's data is not share with anyone.
